    - Sign in to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal with either Compliance admin or Security admin role access and navigate to Data classification > Classifiers.
    - Within 24 hours the trainable classifier will process the seed data and build a prediction model. 
    - Collect at least 200 test content items (10,000 max) for best results.
